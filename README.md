# Twitter food popularity
Short project done for the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" @ UniTS.
The goal is to build a tool for predicting how popular will be a tweet about food. 
## What do this repository contain?
- A short report about the experiment.
- The collected and cleaned dataset obtained during the experiment. Note that this is an imbalanced dataset (in respect to che class "popular"). In the experiment, the dataset has been balanced using the "ROSE" package.
- An R script used to clean and analyze the data and to train the machine learning model. The code used to obtain the data has been obmitted (contact me at gab.cima22@gmail.com if you want this part of the code).
